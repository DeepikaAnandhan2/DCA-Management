## 🎯 **The Problem**

<h3 style="font-weight:800; font-size:30px;">
FedEx loses millions not because customers won’t pay — but because collections are fragmented.
</h3>

FedEx manages thousands of overdue invoices across regions and external **Debt Collection Agencies (DCAs)**.

Today this happens via:

- Excel files  
- Email threads  
- Manual follow-ups  
- No real-time visibility  

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**💥 Business Impact**
- Slow recoveries  
- Missed high-value cases  
- SLA breaches  
- Compliance risk  

</td>
<td width="50%">

**📉 Operational Reality**
- Outdated spreadsheets  
- No priority logic  
- No accountability  
- No audit trail  

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> *“When billions are at stake, Excel is not a system.”*
